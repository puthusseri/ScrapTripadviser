This is a traditional building which is modified amazingly. Go for outside dining if in the evening. Reserving a table in advance would be ideal. This is a type of ambience which I have seen only in Bangalore and Delhi. Dining options are limited but they have managed to include all the cuisines. ( Kerala style, north Indian and oriental). The concept is that the meal is meant for a person so understand well the meal you are ordering and also the quantity. The food quality is very good. The staff is very generous and explains almost all the dishes in the menu. Per head cost will be 500-700 with soup, starters and main course. No beer / wine servings.

The pricing is upmarket and is comparable to a 5 star restaurant. I must also add that it unfortunately do not have a license to serve wine/beer to customers. Nothing exceptional to talk about the food quality, and it was up to the standards you expect from a comparable upmarket restaurant.\n",
