      "The earlier version of Hilton Garden Inn Trivandrum, the Mutthoot Plaza might be a great \"friend\" of several Wi-Fi users of Trivandrum city as its free Wi-Fi was so strong till Spencer's junction even 5yrs back( when Wi-Fi was not as strong as it is now). So, even without a single entry to this hotel, I was very much \"obliged\" to them :D. When they did a make over under the brand Hilton Worldwide, it gives a deluxe World-class experience for the stay and dining of this relatively small city.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had buffet lunch from their Garden Grille Restaurant last week. I was not physically fit to serve myself due to right elbow fracture. But, the hotel employees were too benevolent to make it a memorable experience. Different varieties of soups as starters and Pizza/Pasta following that was a splendid way to start the lunch. We had sweet corn soup, Chicken soup, See food Pizza and Chicken pasta in white sauce. All were peerless in terms of quality and quantity was quite adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I went for the salads( I am unsure whether this is the right sequence to have a buffet lunch ie, to have the salads in between. Since I enquired for salads our boy directed us to that area). Salads are in a separate room and their choices were mind-blowing. There were 3 different chicken salads, 3 different leaves, more than 10 variety of sprouts, several cut fresh vegetables, olives, beef salami , chicken salami , baked beet root pieces cut in square pieces and all were decorated quite beautifully. To my surprise there were two dishes in a corner of the same room- White and Brown chutneys and 2 pretty \"Bharani's (traditional storage vessel of Kerala) were also kept in the same room. The arrangements were too contemporaneous, but this small addition made it absolutely traditional. Kudos for that thought!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The main dishes- plain rice, brown rice, roti, Kerala paratha, tava paratha, veg noodles, chapathi- were accompanied by several curries. Lamb masala, Chicken curry with capsicum, traditional fish curry, beef cake (first time experience) were the non veg series. Chembu masala, achinga thoran, parippu curry, eggplant curry, brinjal fry and 2-3 other dishes (I don't remember the name exactly) were smashing the taste buds wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, their desert range was really the Cherry on top. Nearly 25 variety of puddings including tender coconut, guava, strawberry, lemon etcetera. I don't know how to write the versatility and freshness they have offered. The guava pudding with exactly the flavor of natural guava, I am sorry I don't recollect the exact name of several dishes. Carrot Halwa/cake, Vanilla and Strawberry ice creams were also there in this magnificent final selection. A great dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have two points which rose a hitch. (1) You are delivering exceptional taste and variety in your buffet. But this doesn't include cold water/mineral water. 1 bottle cold water is Rs 99+tax, when comparing to your buffet cost this is relatively high. A very small thing which can be corrected quite easily. I believe cold water should be a mandatory inclusion in all buffet especially when you are not providing juices or any other drinking water in the buffet. (2) Restaurant is directly opposite to main road, and through the transparent glass what you are seeing is the vehicles passing through Punnen Road which is not a great view and to an extent it can kill the ambience inside. I believe, some decorations/arrangements near to that glasses can easily sort this problem out. (Not a major issue, still pointing out; your website is very slow to access from outside if this is it http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/india/hilton-garden-inn-trivandrum-TRVGIGI/index.html Please try to fix the issue as several guests may be directly checking this for booking.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know how your other facilities are working (it seems that too great when going through the other reviews in TripAdvisor). But I can be your ambassador for the lunch buffet, food decorations, arrangement in the restaurant and the obsequious staffs. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend you for anyone. Will definitely visit again to explore \"The Dining Experience\".\n",

This is a traditional building which is modified amazingly. Go for outside dining if in the evening. Reserving a table in advance would be ideal. This is a type of ambience which I have seen only in Bangalore and Delhi. Dining options are limited but they have managed to include all the cuisines. ( Kerala style, north Indian and oriental). The concept is that the meal is meant for a person so understand well the meal you are ordering and also the quantity. The food quality is very good. The staff is very generous and explains almost all the dishes in the menu. Per head cost will be 500-700 with soup, starters and main course. No beer / wine servings. Perfect place for family and friends on a weekend dining.\n",

This should be an unique experience to guests, since the restaurant is housed in an old traditional house. I found the choice of food to be limited and it comprised more of Italian cuisines. The pricing is upmarket and is comparable to a 5 star restaurant. I must also add that it unfortunately do not have a license to serve wine/beer to customers. Nothing exceptional to talk about the food quality, and it was up to the standards you expect from a comparable upmarket restaurant.\n",

We order a prawn dish, but what we got was full of peppers cooked in prawns (despite telling we like little less on spicy). All of us are having severe acidity.

The ambiance is fantastic, the service great, the food is absolutely scrumptious! Go there only if you have time to sit down and relax because the settings take you back in time when things were slower and that's the experience. The best time is at night but lunch is equally great. Ask for today's specials, they are usually great and depends on the season. Great place to have a sit-down meal at leisure!

They put a lot of effort and attention in that, it is wonderful... Look at the toilet... After 20 years in India, i never saw toilet like this !!! We were two people so we took many dishes because we are gourmet and greedy... I am french and I had a very good mother cooker, and sorry i was disappointed about this food, the presentation is nice but the taste is bland... We took fish who was hard and a mango gravy without the mango's taste !!! Only one appetizer with blue cheese was good because we had the taste of the cheese... We took two desserts ; one cake ; no taste and too much sugar and the other was very good ; the tiramisu ...\n",

The restaurant was near empty and we ordered a mixed plate featuring all the favorite non-veg dishes in small portions. By far and away my favorite item was the Syrian beef and the mango shake.... simple 'out of this world' !! The only reason why this place doesn't earn a 5 star TA rating is because some of the items served I wasn't particularly a fan of. However, this doesn't diminish from the overall food experience which was simply wonderful. Also, the service was top notch as well. I look forward to the opportunity of hopefully visiting here again in the future... such a delightful experience !\n",

I had kingfish masala which was perfectly cooked, moist and tender, with a beautiful subtly spiced mustardy sauce, and served with some lovely pulao rice. My partner enjoyed his vegetable curry accompanied by appams. Desserts are always delightful, and different from what you normally get in local restaurants. We shared, so we could taste two desserts and I loved both of them: a chocolate coffee fudge (the coffee flavour could have been more pronounced) with a caramel sauce, and a blueberry and apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. All the dishes were beautifully presented which increases your enjoyment of the food. We expect this at Villa Maya, of course, but it is still a joy.\n",

We ordered one starter (Gulabi Tikki), One soup (tender coconut broth), One tandoori platter, one paneer trio and one dessert (sea salt spiked choco fudge). The gulabi tikki and tender coconut broth are like heaven in your mouth. You want to cry with happiness eating these two dishes. The others were average for the price but decent. Will definitely visit again. The two dishes (gulabi tikki and tender coconut broth) will definitely remind me of the place for a long long time!

      "On every visit to Thiruvananthapuram we have had the intention of visiting Villa Maya, of which we had read and heard so much about. Finally, we did go there on our last visit in February.\n",
      "Having family ties in Thiruvananthapuram, the comments and observations that follow are from someone very familiar with Kerala cuisine and informed of the historical background of the property.\n",
      "We went there with high expectations of the setting, the décor and on the claims made by the establishment about the cuisine. We were intrigued firstly by the claimed combination of Indian, Italian and Moroccan cuisine and their role in “Trivandrum’s culinary history” and “combining traditional cuisine with contemporary style” (extract from their web site). Secondly, to see how well the historical heritage of the property had been preserved and adapted.\n",
      "The setting is beautiful, and the decor extremely well woven into a 18th Century heritage property. We certainly got the feeling of moving back in time as we stepped into the garden patio/courtyard with an imposing “Deepastambham” (“Tower of Lamps” - traditional multi-level oil wick lamp). An effort to keep this lamp lit by modern lighting technology would have made for a stunning entrance (we had recently seen this done in a Cathedral in Budapest where the traditional candles had been replaced by artificial candles that looked real). But alas, it was enveloped in darkness!\n",
      "We were seated in one of the “Gazebos” in the garden, surrounded by water spouts/waterfalls and ponds with fish. An ideal setting for a serene evening. We were very impressed by the lieu and the ambiance. But the lighting could have been better designed to go with the setting.\n",
      "Going through the menu we soon realised that it was, by and large, traditional Kerala cuisine interspersed with some very “standard” dishes for the western palate (Italian for the most part) that was unaccustomed to spicy food and adaptations of North Indian Cuisine for those looking for non-Kerala food. We wished the web site could have avoided all the hype of about the “repertoire of cuisine from countries that historically traded with Kerala”.\n",
      "We chose the “Kappu Udachutu” a very traditional & staple dish made from tapioca and the “Chicken Tikka Makhmali” a variant of the well-known “Katti Roll” family for starters. The tapioca was delicious, browned to perfection and was a very subtle adaptation of the mashed tapioca traditionally eaten in most Kerala homes. We did not see much of Kerala cuisine in the Chicken Tikka Makhmali though, with Mughlai/Tandoor dishes being a new comer to Kerala. However, the wrap was an interesting adaptation of the “Katti” and the blend of spices used for it was indeed different and made it tastier – a counterfoil to the spicy Tikka.\n",
      "For the main course we had “Daab Chingri”, a Bengali prawn curry served in a tender coconut, “Meen Nirachathu”, stuffed fish wrapped in banana leaf and pan fried and “Gobi Mussalam”, a Kerala (??) adaptation of the Mughlai version. All three dishes were well prepared and tasty. The fish, the only truly Kerala dish, was a little overdone and the taste of the raw mango did not come through in the stuffing.\n",
      "It left us wondering about the claim of the restaurant on its website, “Each dish has been carefully handpicked for its cultural heritage, authenticity and resonance with the tastes of Kerala”.\n",
      "Curiosity and nothing else tempted us to try the “Apricot Churros”. It was a total disaster. Presence of Apricots had to be imagined. Turned out to be plain and simple churros that took almost 45 minutes to serve!!\n",
      "Vishak who attended on us was very courteous, attentive and helpful and did his best but was completely unable to overcome the obvious fact that they were understaffed to deal with the number of clients present that day. He apologised profusely for the slow service.\n",
      "It took all of 3 hours from the time we were seated to the time we left.\n",
      "The setting fully lived up to our expectations, the food was good, but the multi-cuisine menu fell way short of our expectations that was set by the description on their website and on the first page of the menu. The copy writer of the web site needs to have a closer dialogue with the Chef.\n",

Great experience and value for money spend.\n",

      "However, something in the meal made two people very ill. Either it was the lime soda (added tap water?) or the pasta/gnocchi (refreshed in tap water maybe?) - or perhaps it was two separate things. Others in the party were fine but as this was the only food these people had in common that day, it doubtless came from this source. Thus, one can only imagine what things are like behind the scenes in the kitchen.\n",

      "Villa Maya exudes warmth and has it's own fan following because it's a heritage property, but would burn a hole in the pocket of a middle class foodie. I will be honest here. Sometimes the food arrives so late, you get impatient, but then they serve you complimentary mini portions of food, well-decorated. You eat, and continue to wait for the main meal to arrive. Sometimes the quantity of food they offer, say when you order something traditional like a plate of steamed tapioca and fish curry, is very less. The fish curry is served in a mini bowl, in a quantity not even sufficient for half of the tapioca. But biriyani, lasagne etc are served in sufficient quantities. What I would like to mention is the desserts. I have tried churros with chocolate and caramel dip, various puddings and mousse, which were all amazing. Villa Maya does not offer value for money. They can and should do better for what they charge.\n",

We arrived there by 7 PM and at that time there was not much rush and the rush was just beginning. We were provided with the menu. From now on we had to face the negligence from the staff. Listing down the service flaws which i and my family faced\n",

But we noticed that on the other tables they were served with welcome drinks and we inquired the same with the waiter who served us. He informed that they forgot and he brought us the welcome drink which we declined since that was supposed to be served as a welcome drink.\n",

      "As I enter the restaurant complex, I realize that I am in for a food experience rather than lunch. Dining is either in an 18th-century Dutch mansion or in private curtained niches in the courtyard garden replete with its water streams.

I will spare you the details of the north Indian platter and zero in on my Syrian Christian food experience, which as expected is fabulous.\n",

      "Syrian Christian fish curry is the first bowl I attack. The fish is seer fish and the curry is spicy and yummy. Beef coconut fry is cooked just right, and is to die for. I would go back just for this dish. The other remarkable dish is anchovy fry with fresh and crisp anchovies adding the right crunch to the meal. The vegetarian part of the thali is good too. Dal, avial, curd rice, karela sabji, Kerala red rice and papads are all uniformly good.\n",

      "1. This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I dined in - its built in an old palace. The al fresco dining with old sculptures and water bodies was lovely, but I chose to dine indoors because it was a pretty warm afternoon.\n",
      "2. The food was ,on the whole, good. I ordered a vegetarian thali. They started off with a tiny pani puri - filled with lemon soda rather than jal jeera! It was yummy. Then a tomato rasam, which was passable, and then the thali. There was rice, along with a beans thoran, aviyal, sambar, ulli thiyal and a yoghurt based curry. The ulli thiyal was just great, the sambar and thoran were good, but the aviyal was fairly tasteless.\n",
      "3. I wasn't in the mood for payasam which was part of the thali , so I chose a dessert from the menu - apricot churros with caramel and chocolate sauce - simply heavenly.\n",
      "4. Excellent service - friendly, polite.\n",
      "What could have been improved :\n",
      "1. Some dishes on the menu were a little bland\n",

      "Evenings are the best time to visit the Villa Maya, especially if you have an important guest. I could get a booking at the exclusive Al fresco dining area which impressed my guest. The atmosphere is very cosy especially on a summer week end when there is some breeze to go by. It is more so because of water falls around and the gurgling sound of water on a summer week end has an electrifying effect on your psyche. The reception was very cordial with and the starters were very juicy crab cakes. It was subtly spiced for any palate and sumptuous. We ordered our main meal and I took my friend for a tour of the old \"Ammachi Veedu\". The three storied mansion presented by the king of Travancore to his dearest concubine - not the queen- was a spacious place with many rooms with antique furniture and always the windows to look out at the main road through which the king used to go on a \"Royal Procession\"..\n",
      "By the time we came back to our island for dinner the dishes were presented in an attractive fashion with large helpings which is enough to share between us even though they are meant for only one person. We went for a leisurely evening and that's what the Villa Maya provided for us. It is interesting to note that even the toilet has the old world charm and the ambiance is maintained from reception to the last detail during the dessert.\n",

I ordered white rice and butter chicken my aunt order chicken biriyani. Within 30 minutes after the order they placed the food in front of our table. Awesome food means awesome. After having the highly charged food made me self compromised by its Quality of food. i recommend this hotel for family and couples.\n",

      "This is a wonderful restaurant in a fabulous colonial building. We go whenever we are in the area, and this time managed two lunches whilst staying in Kovalam.\n",
      "The indoor dining room is beautiful and refined but we prefer the lovely outdoor pavilions surrounded by water. Their food, be it Indian or Western, is always imaginative and beautifully presented. You start with a lovely amuse bouche every time. We shared a Painter's Vegetarian Platter as a starter, pretty as a picture and very tasty, too. I enjoyed my trio of paneer, all prepared in a different marinade. My partner's chicken biriyani was nice, although presented in a different manner from a traditional Hyderabadi one, and not quite as good. Portions, as always, were generous and we didn't manage dessert.\n",
      "The second visit was equally delightful. We enjoyed some refreshing complimentary pani puris, and omitted a starter so we could have desserts. My partner chose a hearty, beautifully spiced chole served with the most fluffy and light Kerala paratha. I had a mango scented kingfish fillet, served in a mango leaf on a delicate risotto with spinach, and surrounded by a vegetable mirepoix. Perfection! This time we had desserts, which we shared: a chocolate lava cake and a brownie with nuts and ice cream. Both were yummy and a real treat, especially when ordinary restaurants don't offer anything other than pancakes or ice cream.\n",
      "They are not licensed, but if you want anything other than water, they do excellent lassis and fresh juices.\n",
      "Service is occasionally slower than it should be, but generally the waiters are very pleasant, informative, well mannered and happy to help; they seem to take pride in their job. On our first visit their credit card machine didn't work so we had to get cash from an ATM across the road. An inconvenience, but if was sorted the next time.\n",
      "Meals at a restaurant of this caliber don't come cheap, but are still very affordable, considering the ambiance and the quality and presentation of the food. For our two course lunches for two we paid INR1900 and INR2450 respectively. We will certainly go again next time we are in Kerala.\n",

There is a 'wow' factor the moment you walk through the entrance and this continues throughout your visit.\n",

We enjoyed our first visit so much that we immediately booked a second and every choice we had was of a very high quality. The Manager, Vidya and Assistant Manager PK are attentive, friendly and professional. The service waiters (we had Sarran) are again excellent and just attentive enough without being intrusive.\n",

      "We came for lunch to villa maya at 2pm . We were seated upstairs and our order was taken within 5-10 minutes of getting the menu . We ordered the seafood platter as appetizer and lasooni gosht and syrian beef fry as main course . By 3.15pm , we still hadnt gotten our appetizers and upon reminding them that we werent served our appetizers , they said all the food that we had ordered was dropped down and were being made again , which sounded pretty lame to us and they shouldnt have taken all that time to let us know what was happening with the food. By 3.30 we were ready to get up and leave , which is when our appetizer arrived . The seafood platter consisted of squid , fish and prawns. It tasted bland and after waiting nearly an hour and a half for our food it was such a disappointment . Next came the lasooni gosht and the syrian beef fry . The lasooni gosht was alright , it wasnt amazing but it was the only good thing we ate there. Upon letting the server know the food wasnt good and they should have let us know there would be a delay in getting the food , they gave us a tiramisu . The total meal came upto Rs 3100 ,for something that didnt even taste good .We came here in August 2016 and were so impressed with the food that we decided to try it out again . We are never coming back here , there are so many better options in the city.\n"

Menu and choice of meals are excellent.. though very very pricey. Once you get over the price and order food, each and every item that comes to your table tastes very very good. We ordered plains meals and also continental and north indian food. All were perfect in taste and cooking. Service is very good.

So this time I had to write and let the visitors to Kovalam, Kerala know that they must visit this restaurant in Trivandrum. The restaurant is located in 18th century Dutch manor house. There are tables inside the house, the patio and the courtyard. At night the atmosphere is totally magical. Subdued lighting, fragrant air, tables under the canopies and trees give this place amazing ambience. The service and the food made the whole evening magical for us. We just set under one of the canopy and soaked in the atmosphere. We ordered North Indian paneer dishes. All of them cooked perfectly. The panipuri served for amuse bouchée was so great that we just wanted to ask for more. The best part was the dessert, Gulabjamun Panna cotta!\n",

The water, fish all around, the lightings and paint- everything adds up to offer the best authentic Kerela experience. The food is amazing too. The nariyal paani soup is recommended for sure. Also the desserts are a highlight. I personally loved the caramel sause in rich chocolate cake. Easily one of the best places to visit if you want a taste of God’s own country.\n",

No wonder this place has such a formidable reputation! Portions were large so we had no room for pudding. The whole meal cost 1764 rupees including tax. Expensive but worth it.

There was a chicken dish that I can't remember as it was a 3-word name was exceptionally tasty, so was the chicken bhartha and methi chicken. But the tandoori dishes had a peculiar taste of the coloring which is common in many restaurants. The brownie with caramel sauce was exceptionally delicious.

They said the tables we asked for were already reserved for someone else, then why give us a confirmation for the same as that was one of the reasons we went there. Anyways! Ordered the starters & mains the starters arrived cold, the Pepsi & coconut water arrived when our mains were served, some of the local food we ordered was good no doubt but the bad service just ruined the whole experience. I think it's an overrated place as there are not many options to eat in Trivandrum, plus service plays an important part to your whole experience, which I guess they lack in proffesional staff to handle situations like these. Stick to the local dishes available on the menu avoid the continental ones as you will be disappointed! Also, they don't have any liquor license, therefore you will not get any liquor here to accompany your meal.\n",

On a recent visit, though we had a reservation via Ms. Vidya in one of the alcoves, they relegated us to an awful table close to the restrooms. When we reminded them that we had requested an alcove booking they said it could not be done because they could not add the extra chair we requested. This was NOT what they us told on on the phone at the time of making the reservation.\n",

The wait staff staff as well as those that show us to tables have no concept of hospitality or politeness. Instead they are argumentative, bordering on rude.\n",
      "To compound the problem, the new menu is terrible, my fish curry was awful and the fish hard like stones. Our guests had similar problems with the food as well. I would have been happy to chalk the bad food down to an uninformed choice on my part, but no excuse can be made for the bad behavior and poor manners of the staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a contrast to this, the following day, we had brunch at Bait, Taj Kovalam and it was amazing, the food was exceptional and we were attended to by at least 5 different waiters/managers who ensured that our every request was met. If something was not on the menu, it was arranged with a smile and the meal was fabulous.\n",

      "Shame on you Villa Maya for dropping all your standards to this low level by employing sub-standard staff and serving poor quality food. When you started out years ago, we were among your first customers and have been loyal to you since.

      "While travelling from Male to New Delhi with my husband, we had a 7 hours stop in Trivandrum, from 6pm to 1am. Timing was really odd for us to explore the city, especially with the luggage. So we thought of spending some time in Villa Maya as it was very close from Terminal 2. We went there because the location was really convenient. But, our visit turned out to be beyond our expectation and simply fantastic. Special thanks to Anjali ji and all the other staff who made us feel at home with their extraordinary hospitality. They took care of our luggage and asked us to feel comfortable and spend as much time as we want, so much so that they were willing to go beyond their operational working hours. The food was also amazing. Each and every dish we tried was worth it. After we finished our dinner, we were offered kaapi, their traditional coffee, which was also really nice. Thanks to all the staff there for making our short stay in Trivandrum so memorable.\n",

What we didn't expect was a wonderful and aesthetic journey into this heritage hotel which instantly transported us to a different tranquil world. The food- all taste excellent from appams to Mediterranean cuisine, the staff - pleasant and friendly (especially Girish) most of all, what won our hearts about Villa Maya was the ambience which is beyond charming. A song and dance of fountains, coconut groves, koi ponds with lotus and fish, the ornate pestle and mortar with other aesthetic elements and the pools even in the restrooms which looked like a zen area all compliment this enchanting restaurant. Do visit for a beautiful experience!\n",

We have come away completely satisfied with our experience. Dinning at Villa Maya is not just bout the food...it's about the ambiance, where the old-age charm of the restaurant lends itself to the dinning experience. Every little nook and corner has something you can feast your eyes on.\n",

And yes it's not something they have any control over, but I have to say this that it would have been oh so perfect to be able to sit an sip on a nice cocktail or glass of wine, surrounded by all that perfection.\n",

Their contemporary cuisine is expertly crafted and beautifully presented. Think sundried bashed beef in a betel leaf with finely chopped raw mango, wattalapam – a sweet delicacy from Sri Lanka, sea food rasam, seasonal fruit popsicles and hazelnut brownies with cream. For the non experimental, there was a traditional vegetarian and non-vegetarian thali. A meal for five set us back by INR 5000. Reasonable for the one-time experience, I’d say!\n",

One litre bottle of water was charged @ Rs, 75/- plus taxes which is way above the M.R.P. On food value of 3000/- Taxes charged 21.5% plus 5% S.R.C ? amounting to Rs.774/-.

We then shared Nadan Kozhi curry, a very tasty rustic chicken curry with robust flavours, served with fluffy Kerala parartha, and Vendakka Varuthathu, which are beautifully prepared okra served with some dhal and rice. Every mouthful was excellent. The desserts were certainly the pieces de resistance: very, very yummy. We had a passion and coconut cheesecake, light and melt in the mouth. The same applied to the Trio of Tiramisu, three small glassed flavoured with chocolate, orange, and I think, caramel respectively. Just mouthwatering!\n",

The menu is extensive and wide-ranging in style, though there are plenty of Keralan items on the menu, and there is a Keralan twist to some other dishes. Everything we had was superb and beautifully presented, and the setting is lovely, whether you are inside or out. Eating outside on a warm winter's evening, we did draw the attention of quite a few mosquitos, but the staff quickly provided repellents - if you are very bothered by them, however, you'd probably be better to eat indoors. The manager chatted to us for quite some time: he was friendly and informative without being too present. Staff went to a lot of trouble to get us a taxi after the meal - we were staying some way out of the city centre, and in a location that wasn't well known to the local drivers, so they made doubly sure we would be all right.

The food is surely one the best I have eaten in India ever. Whether it is traditional Indian , Kerala platter or be it something exotic like the mozzarella breadsticks, it surely gives the best restaurants in the country run for their money. The list of vegetarian and non vegetarian is extensive with a lot of innovative signature dishes like painter's platter. This doesn't ends here , even the sweet dishes they present is much beyond and above your expectations. The taste and presentation is matchless .

When you go to a fine dinning restaurant you are expecting the full package, service + food. Also when it is advertised on the website as the second best restaurant in India you tend to have high expectations. On the hand the food here is amazing. We started with selection of 5 courses. The amuse bouche, WOW! What a start to a amazing meal the local flavors hit my palate. We went for more local Indian foods except for desert not too sure if the western food taste as good as the Indian food but they do have a variety of western food on the menu. What a pity that the service does not accompany the high quality of the cooking. Some thing I also notice the staff was paying a lot more attention to the western dinners.\n",

      "#2 in India and #1 in tvm has just become a name now. They spoilt my anniversary by promising something and doing nothing. I did the reservation at 11am via email and call and the person who took my reservation ( Manoj) claimed to be Sr. f&b manager and boasted about himself. He promised to arrange me a hut and a complimentary cake for my anniversary. I would have ordered one myself , had he not mentioned about the complimentary cake . When I arrived I was told there was no hut and was asked to occupy a table inside. After I rejected that idea, I was made to sit for 15 mins until a hut was arranged. The starters ( tandoori) took 30 mins to come but they were served very very cold. The mains took another 30 mins. As I finished our dinner n waited for the cake they only got me the bill for 4K. Thank you Manoj & Villa maya team for making my precious day a flop. Yu don't owe any apology, as precious moments are priceless and they cannot be got back. N if the Sr. Manager is like this, god save you all ! Worst experience on a precious day ! Regret for spending so much for absolutely not worthy stuff !\n",

The idyllic setting of the mansion/fort, a tastefully done garden and superbly helpful staff are the few things (apart from the delectable cuisines) that set this amazing restaurant apart. Service was prompt and the Masala prawns were probably the best I have had till date. I have been chasing biryanis across the country and the mutton biryani here is great - though lags behind a bit from the street biryanis that I had in Poorva.\n",

I have had inferior meals in places not as pleasant for similar charges.\n",

The food though was reasonable in terms of variety and taste.The staff were attentive, and though we did not complain,as we left the maitre d said that as everything was made from scratch, it took a long time coming.Perhaps even he felt guilty about how long it took.Not a place to visit if you are in a hurry.\n"

Its a beautiful villa with its own interesting history, and both the indoors and outdoors seating very aesthetically arranged. We opted for the indoors seating and had a room with its own period furniture , mirrors, and chandelier, all to ourselves. The pani puri \"on the house\" was a pleasant surprise and lip smacking! For starters , we ordered baked crabs with garlic butter and dohra kebabs (lamb mince and chicken) and they were delicious- as were the mains (chicken panquette, pasta in white sauce with prawns , and appam with kerala style mutton). For dessert, we had kulfi (three different flavours served on sticks) and turkish brownies with nut crunch icecream... truly heavenly! The service was gracious and attentive .

When it's cooler, eating in the garden is delightful - especially in one of the gazebos, and with the sounds of the water features masking the city noises, you forget you are right in centre of Trivandrum. I often come here for a peaceful solo lunch when on business in the city, or for dinner with friends or with my husband. Last year we enjoyed a wonderful romantic Christmas dinner here. The food is tasty and beautifully-presented and you can get many European dishes which are not available elsewhere in Trivandrum or Kovalam. The staff are wonderful and when I booked for last Friday night, I was asked if we were celebrating anything special. It was actually a night out with friends at the start of our yoga-holiday season in Kovalam. At the end of our meal we were presented with jasmine and a delicious light chocolate cake iced with the words: Celebrating the Joy of Life. Such a charming touch! In the hot summer months I love the cool of the air-conditioned rooms inside, and there are even beds where you can lounge and dine - Roman-style! A treat for all the senses.\n",

The sauce had no seasoning and when i asked about it- they said halibut was the sauce and creole was the fish. the fish was also over cooked and dry.The bill was $60/- for that dish- which I would say is worth it if it tasted better. Next time ill try only indian food here, if I ever go back! Probably not!. The part that really bugged me was that they wanted me to fill out a review card and I said the ambiance was excellent - service was good and food was fair.
